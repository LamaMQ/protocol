# Introduction
This document is used as roadmap for protocol evolution.

## V1
In protocol V1, we want to create a full protocol for simple architecture, one server, multiple middleware, and client.

## V2
In protocol V2, we want to introduce multiple servers architectures acting like one server, with grid of middleware acting like one client, similar, grid of client applications acting like one client.

## Future
In future version of V2, we want to introduce permission system to handle restricted access on a client or a middleware.
